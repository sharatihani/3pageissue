            <p>Visual media exposes us to false realities and unrealistic expectations, often sparking a shift in perspective of how we view ourselves.
              A jarring example is the significant influence social media and technology have on teenagers and young adults, shaping the way they perceive their self and body image.
              With the growth of technology and constant exposure to influencers and digital media, and specifically, filters, it can be said that there has been a drastic 
              increase in pressure on how we should <i>ideally</i> look like. </p>
            <p>The media has taken a toll on the mental health of many teens. I have time and time again found myself dwelling on reaching the specific standard of beauty as portrayed
              on Instagram or Snapchat feeds. This is a global issue; the standards have been <i>set</i> across the world through social media and to conform to an unrealistic standard
              of beauty leads to mental health being abused. It has always been emphasised that <i>“beauty comes from within”</i>, but in the context of our current digital-aged society,
              that <i>"beauty"</i> tends to be from within our phone screens. </p>
