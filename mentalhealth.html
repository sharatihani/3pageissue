          <h3 style="font-size:200%;"> Stress and Social Media </h3>
          <p>While seeing your own imperfections in the mirror is nothing new, having the knowledge about what you could look like without them is.
            “The more time people spend on social media, the more their brains are being affected by the content they are exposing themselves to.
            For some, this means it encourages them to view their own, natural appearance as being unacceptable,” says Patrick J. Byrne, MD.
            Adding to the problem: There’s a desire to repetitively view your social media accounts throughout the day, as they update constantly.
            In Everyday Health’s stress survey, <b>57 percent</b> of respondents, including baby boomers and those among Generation Z, reported looking at their social media accounts daily.
          </p>
          <p>Dwelling on those perceived imperfections or flaws can make anyone feel terrible.
            “This habit can trigger a sense of <i>insecurity</i>, which can lead to a stress response in the body,” says Sari Shepphird, PhD, a body image specialist and psychologist in Los Angeles.
            This can lead to a cyclical pattern of negative thoughts. You’re stressed about a flaw, feel as if you need to change your appearance, then spend time and resources doing so, which can create more stress, she says.
            The difference today is the fixation on the small things that people may not have bothered to become consumed with before. “Patients are more obsessed about small imperfections.
            They like the way they look after they experiment with filters and editing apps. Their tolerance for a bump on their nose, acne breakouts, a little thigh bulge, or thin lips seems to be a little lower than previous generations,” says Dr. Schwartz.

      <h3 style="font-size:200%;"> Can Snapchat Trigger Body Dysmorphic Disorder? </h3>
      <p>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental illness that can lead affected individuals to have frequent thoughts about their appearance; seek constant reassurance from others that they look okay; check their appearance in the mirror or other reflective surfaces repeatedly; avoid social situations to prevent others from seeing them; and use hats, scarves, and makeup to conceal the perceived flaw, according to the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF). People with BDD also often seek cosmetic surgeries to “fix” their perceived imperfections.
      </p>

      <p>One of the causes of BDD could be indirectly related to the technological advances we are exposed to. For example, several plastic surgeons have shared their experiences whereby they encountered requests sounding similar to what a "filtered" Snapchat picture would look like. The term <b>"Snapchat Dysmorphia"</b> was also coined (Ramphul & Mejias, 2018.) According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), BDD is classified along the obsessive-compulsive Spectrum. Those suffering from BDD are preoccupied with at least one nonexistent or slight defect in physical appearance, which Snapchat filters may fool them to believe they possess. This could lead them to think about the defect for at least one hour a day, therefore impacting their social, occupational, and other levels of functioning.
      </p>

      <p> The fact that surgeons have received requests similar to what a filtered version of the individual would look like, shows that there are women who may be preoccupied with slight defects in their physical appearance and could potentially be placed on the obsessive-compulsive disorder. The risk of these patients turning to Snapchat and Instagram filters as a source of inspiration for their desired plastic surgeries is a huge issue; if young teenage girls are exposed to digital manipulation on their faces at such a young age, wouldn’t this only increase their chances of developing signs of BDD and significant mental health issues?
